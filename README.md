# Why have I made it?

This script was developed as part of a time-series analysis project to explore predictive modeling for sequential data. Its purpose is to demonstrate the application of advanced time-series methods such as ARIMA for modeling trends and GARCH for capturing volatility. By applying these models, I aimed to gain insights into seasonal patterns and residual behavior within the data.
